# Copilot Collaboration Changelog

This file tracks the work done together with GitHub Copilot on the Square360 Shared Pantheon Workflows repository.

## 2025-10-23

### Added

- **Copilot Instructions File**: Created comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with detailed guidelines for working with GitHub Actions and Pantheon workflows
  - Documented workflow patterns and conventions
  - Included pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon@0.7.0 usage guidelines
  - Added semantic release integration patterns
  - Defined code quality standards and security considerations
  - Provided testing and maintenance guidelines
  - Created template for new workflows

- **Copilot Changelog**: Created `CHANGELOG-COPILOT.md` to track collaborative work sessions

### Research & Documentation

- **pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon Action Versioning Analysis**
  - Researched official Pantheon repository to understand versioning strategy
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Action is in "Early Access" (pre-1.0.0) with active development
    - Default branch: `0.x`
    - Pantheon officially recommends exact version pinning (e.g., `@0.7.0`)
    - No major version tags (`@v0`) available yet
    - Breaking changes possible between minor versions
    - Input parameter names may change before 1.0.0 release
  - **Decision:** Continue using `@0.7.0` exact version pinning (aligns with Pantheon's guidance)
  - **Updated Documentation:** Enhanced copilot instructions with versioning rationale and update strategy

### Feature Implementation

- **Slack Notifications Integration**
  - Added Slack notification support to both deployment workflows
  - **New inputs added:**
    - `slack_channel`: Optional channel name for notifications (repo variable)
    - `slack_webhook_url`: Optional webhook URL for Slack integration (organization variable)
  - **Notification features:**
    - Success/failure/cancelled status with appropriate emojis and colors
    - Repository, environment, site, and status information
    - Environment URL links (when deployment succeeds)
    - Workflow run links for troubleshooting
    - Pull request links for multidev deployments
  - **Implementation approach:**
    - Used native curl commands instead of external actions for reliability
    - Added job outputs to pass environment URLs between jobs
    - Conditional logic to handle different deployment outcomes
  - **Files modified:**
    - `reusable-deploy-pantheon.yml`: Added Slack notification job
    - `reusable-deploy-multidev.yml`: Added Slack notification job
    - Added `examples/slack-notifications.yml` for usage reference
  - **Documentation updated:** Added Slack notifications section to copilot instructions

### Repository Analysis

- Analyzed existing workflow files:
  - `reusable-deploy-pantheon.yml` - Main deployment workflow with semantic release
  - `reusable-deploy-multidev.yml` - PR-based multidev deployments
  - `reusable-semantic-release.yml` - Standalone semantic release workflow
- Documented current pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon action version (0.7.0)
- Identified key patterns for Terminus CLI usage and Drupal deployment commands
- Reviewed secret and input parameter conventions across workflows

### Context Established

- Repository serves as shared workflow library for Square360 Pantheon projects
- Workflows are designed for reusability across multiple Drupal site repositories
- Current focus on standardizing deployment patterns and semantic versioning
- Branch context: Working on `fix/semantic-release` branch

### Next Steps

- Consider updating pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon action to newer version if available
- Evaluate workflow performance and optimization opportunities
- Consider adding additional reusable workflows for common Pantheon tasks
- Review and enhance error handling across all workflows
