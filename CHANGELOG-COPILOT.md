# Copilot Collaboration Changelog

This file tracks the work done together with GitHub Copilot on the Square360 Shared Pantheon Workflows repository.

## 2025-10-23

### Added

- **Copilot Instructions File**: Created comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with detailed guidelines for working with GitHub Actions and Pantheon workflows
  - Documented workflow patterns and conventions
  - Included pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon@0.7.0 usage guidelines
  - Added semantic release integration patterns
  - Defined code quality standards and security considerations
  - Provided testing and maintenance guidelines
  - Created template for new workflows

- **Copilot Changelog**: Created `CHANGELOG-COPILOT.md` to track collaborative work sessions

### Research & Documentation

- **pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon Action Versioning Analysis**
  - Researched official Pantheon repository to understand versioning strategy
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Action is in "Early Access" (pre-1.0.0) with active development
    - Default branch: `0.x`
    - Pantheon officially recommends exact version pinning (e.g., `@0.7.0`)
    - No major version tags (`@v0`) available yet
    - Breaking changes possible between minor versions
    - Input parameter names may change before 1.0.0 release
  - **Decision:** Continue using `@0.7.0` exact version pinning (aligns with Pantheon's guidance)
  - **Updated Documentation:** Enhanced copilot instructions with versioning rationale and update strategy

### Feature Implementation

- **Slack Notifications Integration**
  - Added Slack notification support to both deployment workflows
  - **New inputs added:**
    - `slack_channel`: Optional channel name for notifications (repo variable)
    - `slack_webhook_url`: Optional webhook URL for Slack integration (organization variable)
  - **Notification features:**
    - Success/failure/cancelled status with appropriate emojis and colors
    - Repository, environment, site, and status information
    - Environment URL links (when deployment succeeds)
    - Workflow run links for troubleshooting
    - Pull request links for multidev deployments
  - **Implementation approach:**
    - Used native curl commands instead of external actions for reliability
    - Added job outputs to pass environment URLs between jobs
    - Conditional logic to handle different deployment outcomes
  - **Files modified:**
    - `reusable-deploy-pantheon.yml`: Added Slack notification job
    - `reusable-deploy-multidev.yml`: Added Slack notification job
    - Added `examples/slack-notifications.yml` for usage reference
  - **Documentation updated:** Added Slack notifications section to copilot instructions

### Repository Analysis

- Analyzed existing workflow files:
  - `reusable-deploy-pantheon.yml` - Main deployment workflow with semantic release
  - `reusable-deploy-multidev.yml` - PR-based multidev deployments
  - `reusable-semantic-release.yml` - Standalone semantic release workflow
- Documented current pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon action version (0.7.0)
- Identified key patterns for Terminus CLI usage and Drupal deployment commands
- Reviewed secret and input parameter conventions across workflows

### Context Established

- Repository serves as shared workflow library for Square360 Pantheon projects
- Workflows are designed for reusability across multiple Drupal site repositories
- Current focus on standardizing deployment patterns and semantic versioning
- Branch context: Working on `fix/semantic-release` branch

### Next Steps

- Consider updating pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon action to newer version if available
- Evaluate workflow performance and optimization opportunities
- Consider adding additional reusable workflows for common Pantheon tasks
- Review and enhance error handling across all workflows

### Feature Enhancement - Error Handling in Slack Notifications

- **Enhanced Slack Notifications with Error Reporting**
  - Added comprehensive error capture and reporting to Slack notifications
  - **New functionality:**
    - Captures specific failed step information (deployment, database updates, config import, etc.)
    - Includes detailed error messages in Slack notifications
    - Provides fallback messaging when specific error details aren't available
    - Maintains existing success notification features

- **Implementation Details:**
  - **Job Outputs Added**: Enhanced both workflows with `failed_step` and `error_message` outputs
  - **Error Capture Logic**: Added `capture_error` steps that run on deployment failure
  - **Step Identification**: Uses `steps.<step_id>.conclusion` to identify which specific step failed
  - **Conditional Error Fields**: Slack notifications dynamically include error information only when deployments fail
  - **Visual Indicators**: Failed deployments show with red color coding and ‚ùå emoji in Slack

- **Files Modified:**
  - `reusable-deploy-pantheon.yml`: Added error capture step and enhanced Slack notification with error fields
  - `reusable-deploy-multidev.yml`: Added error capture step and enhanced Slack notification with error fields
  - Both workflows now include contextual error messages for failed deployments

- **Error Handling Architecture:**
  - **Step-Level Detection**: Identifies failures at individual step level (push-to-pantheon, drush commands, etc.)
  - **Safe Error Capture**: Captures error context without exposing sensitive information
  - **Graceful Degradation**: Provides meaningful fallback messages when specific error details aren't captured
  - **Always-Run Notifications**: Slack notifications execute regardless of deployment outcome using `if: always()`

- **Operational Benefits:**
  - **Faster Incident Response**: Teams get immediate notification of what went wrong
  - **Reduced Troubleshooting Time**: Specific error information eliminates need to dig through GitHub Actions logs
  - **Better Visibility**: Failed deployments now provide actionable information directly in Slack
  - **Improved Reliability**: Enhanced error reporting helps maintain deployment quality

### Documentation Updates

- **Copilot Instructions Enhanced**: Error handling patterns and Slack notification architecture documented
- **Session Tracking**: Comprehensive documentation of error handling implementation approach
- **Technical Decisions**: Documented rationale for step-level error capture vs. job-level error handling

### Collaboration Context

- **Working Branch**: `fix/slack-notify` (switched from `fix/semantic-release`)
- **Session Focus**: Error handling enhancement for deployment failure scenarios
- **Implementation Approach**: Iterative development with step-by-step error capture enhancement
- **Quality Assurance**: Followed GitHub Actions best practices for conditional execution and error handling

### Technical Implementation Notes

- **Error Message Sources**: Captures errors from pantheon-systems/push-to-pantheon action and Terminus/Drush commands
- **Slack Integration**: Uses native curl commands with JSON payload construction for reliable delivery
- **Security Considerations**: Error messages filtered to prevent exposure of sensitive deployment details
- **Cross-Workflow Consistency**: Error handling patterns standardized across both deployment workflows
